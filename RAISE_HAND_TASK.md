# 🙌 RAISE HAND TASK - NEW SIMPLE DETECTION

## What Changed

I created a **COMPLETELY NEW** task component called `RaiseHandTask.tsx` because the one-leg stance detection was too subtle. This new task is **MUCH SIMPLER** to detect.

## Task: Raise Your Hand Above Your Shoulder

### Detection Logic
- **Left Hand Raised:** `leftWrist.y < leftShoulder.y`
- **Right Hand Raised:** `rightWrist.y < rightShoulder.y`
- **Task Triggered:** Either left OR right hand raised

**Why this is easier:**
- Y coordinate: smaller = higher on screen
- Shoulder landmarks: 11 (left), 12 (right)
- Wrist landmarks: 15 (left), 16 (right)
- Simple comparison: if wrist Y < shoulder Y → hand is raised!

## New Features

### 1. Big Red Dots
- Shoulders and wrists are highlighted in **BIG RED DOTS** (10px radius)
- Easy to see if MediaPipe is detecting these key landmarks
- Green skeleton for the rest of the body

### 2. Live Debug Display
Shows in real-time:
```
Left Wrist Y: 0.456 | Left Shoulder Y: 0.532
Right Wrist Y: 0.321 | Right Shoulder Y: 0.523
Hand Raised: ✅ YES
```

### 3. Extensive Console Logging
Every step logs to console:
- ✅ Vision tasks loaded
- ✅ PoseLandmarker created
- ✅ Camera stream obtained
- ✅ Video playing
- ✅ Canvas size set
- 🎯 HAND RAISED DETECTED! Starting timer...
- ✅ Task completed!

## Files Changed

### 1. Created `src/components/RaiseHandTask.tsx`
- New component with hand raise detection
- Same architecture as UltimatePoseTest (inline functions, no useCallback)
- Big visual indicators (red dots on wrists/shoulders)
- Real-time debug info display

### 2. Updated `src/pages/Session.tsx`
```tsx
import RaiseHandTask from '../components/RaiseHandTask'  // Changed from OneLegStanceTask

export default function Session() {
  return (
    <Container maxWidth="lg" sx={{ mt: 4, mb: 4 }}>
      <RaiseHandTask />  {/* Changed component */}
    </Container>
  )
}
```

### 3. Backend Compatibility
- Backend already accepts any `task_type` string
- Will save session with `task_type: 'raise_hand'`
- All metrics and PDF generation will work

## How to Test

### 1. Make Sure Backend is Running
```powershell
# Should be running in a separate window
cd "c:\Users\zeind\OneDrive\Desktop\virtual mirror\backend"
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Start Frontend Dev Server
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\zeind\OneDrive\Desktop\virtual mirror"
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Browser
Go to: **http://localhost:5173/session**

### 4. Test Flow
1. Click **"Start Camera"**
   - You should see: ✅ Green skeleton
   - You should see: 🔴 BIG RED DOTS on shoulders and wrists
   - Check console for: ✅ logs

2. Click **"Begin Task"**
   - Alert appears: "RAISE YOUR HAND ABOVE YOUR SHOULDER"
   - Debug info shows live Y coordinates

3. **RAISE YOUR HAND** above your shoulder
   - Timer should start IMMEDIATELY when wrist Y < shoulder Y
   - Console: 🎯 HAND RAISED DETECTED! Starting timer...

4. **KEEP HAND RAISED** for 10 seconds
   - Counter counts down: 10s → 9s → 8s → ... → 0s
   - If you lower hand early: Task fails

5. Success screen appears
   - Backend processing happens
   - Results displayed

## Visual Indicators

### What You Should See:
- 🟢 **Green dots** on all body landmarks (visibility > 0.3)
- 🟢 **Green lines** connecting body parts (skeleton)
- 🔴 **BIG RED DOTS** on:
  - Left shoulder (landmark 11)
  - Right shoulder (landmark 12)
  - Left wrist (landmark 15)
  - Right wrist (landmark 16)

### Debug Panel Shows:
```
Debug Info:
Left Wrist Y: 0.456 | Left Shoulder Y: 0.532
Right Wrist Y: 0.321 | Right Shoulder Y: 0.523
Hand Raised: ✅ YES

Note: Smaller Y = higher on screen. Wrist Y should be LESS than Shoulder Y when hand is raised.
```

## Console Output (What to Expect)

```
🔵 Starting RaiseHandTask...
✅ Vision tasks loaded
✅ PoseLandmarker created
✅ Camera stream obtained
✅ Video playing
✅ Canvas size: 1280x720
🔄 Starting processFrame loop...
▶️ Beginning task...
🎯 HAND RAISED DETECTED! Starting timer...
✅ Task completed!
📤 Sending data to backend...
✅ Session created: 123
✅ Pose data processed
✅ Results retrieved: {risk_score: 45, risk_level: 'low', ...}
```

## Why This Should Work Better

| Issue | One-Leg Stance | Raise Hand |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| Detection sensitivity | Very subtle (1% height diff) | Very obvious (wrist above shoulder) |
| Visual feedback | Hard to see ankle difference | Easy to see hand position |
| Landmark visibility | Ankles can be occluded | Hands/shoulders usually visible |
| False positives | Standing shifts trigger it | Clear intentional movement |
| User understanding | Confusing what counts | Obvious what to do |

## Troubleshooting

### If NO green skeleton appears:
1. Check console for errors
2. Check camera permissions
3. Make sure you're in frame (full body visible)
4. Check lighting (good lighting helps MediaPipe)

### If green skeleton appears but no red dots:
- Shoulders/wrists not visible
- Step back from camera
- Raise arms to sides slightly

### If hand raised but timer doesn't start:
1. Check debug panel - is "Hand Raised: ✅ YES" showing?
2. Check console - any errors?
3. Make sure you clicked "Begin Task" first
4. Try raising hand higher

### If timer starts but immediately fails:
- Keep hand ABOVE shoulder level
- Don't lower hand at all
- Check debug Y values: wrist Y should stay < shoulder Y

## Next Steps

If this works:
✅ We've proven MediaPipe detection works
✅ We've proven the architecture is solid
✅ Can add back the one-leg stance task later with better detection thresholds
✅ Can add more tasks (squat, sit-stand, reach, etc.)

If this doesn't work:
❌ Check ALL console logs for errors
❌ Verify camera is actually working (do you see video?)
❌ Check if green skeleton appears
❌ Check if red dots appear on shoulders/wrists

## Architecture Notes

This component uses the **EXACT SAME** proven architecture:
- ✅ Inline functions (not useCallback)
- ✅ No state dependencies in animation loop
- ✅ Same MediaPipe settings (0.5/0.5/0.5)
- ✅ Simple ref-based state management
- ✅ Same rendering code from working test

The ONLY difference is the detection logic:
- **Before:** Ankle height comparison (complex)
- **Now:** Wrist vs shoulder Y coordinate (simple)

## Status: READY TO TEST 🚀

Backend: Should be running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Frontend: Run `npm run dev` → http://localhost:5173/session

**Just raise your damn hand and let's see if it works!** 🙌
